Many people who love git have a tendency to get excited by the internals of it; how it does the things that make it so great. For the uninitiated, these details can be intimidating and more than a little opaque. We'll look at a (very) brief over-view of what git is and isn't, then get to the more important question to the working developer: "How do I use it?" We'll look at commonly used commands, discuss various work-flows, and compare and contrast subversion's ways of doing things. The focus will be on how to get things done, not how does git work.

Some new text. I'm working some code, here. Something else.
